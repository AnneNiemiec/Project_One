#### Stacked Bar Plot showing Vaccine Allocations by State on latest date present in the data

* x-axis = State

* y-axis = 
    * Bar 1: Pfizer cumulative 1st dose allocation
    * Bar 2: Pfizer cumulative 2nd dose allocation
    * Bar 3: Moderna cumulative 1st dose allocation
    * Bar 4: Moderna cumulative 2nd dose allocation
    * Bar 5: Johnson & Johnson cumulative single dose allocation
    
#### Stacked Bar Plot showing Vaccine Allocations Normalized by State Population by State on latest date present in the data

* x-axis = State

* y-axis = 
    * Bar 1: Pfizer cumulative 1st dose allocation / State Population
    * Bar 2: Pfizer cumulative 2nd dose allocation / State Population
    * Bar 3: Moderna cumulative 1st dose allocation / State Population
    * Bar 4: Moderna cumulative 2nd dose allocation / State Population
    * Bar 5: Johnson & Johnson cumulative single dose allocation / State Population 

#### 3 plot figure of Stacked Bar Plots showing Vaccine Allocations by State on latest date present in the data

* x-axis = State
    * Note, this is common to all 3 figures and should only be displayed on the bottom figure.

* Plot 1, y-axis:
    * Bar 1: Pfizer cumulative 1st dose allocation
    * Bar 2: Pfizer cumulative 2nd dose allocation
* Plot 2, y-axis:
    * Bar 1: Moderna cumulative 1st dose allocation
    * Bar 2: Moderna cumulative 2nd dose allocation
* Plot 3, y-axis:
    * Bar: Johnson & Johnson cumulative single dose allocation
